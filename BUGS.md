 When trying to "Edit" an employee's record, it shows the error message "Couldn't find Employee with 'id'=1"
 when actually the employee I try to edit has a different ID.

Error: All the autogenerated <td> for every employee in the employees list contains the wrong autogenerated path in "href".
      
#### Solution: 
fix the edit_company_employee_path(employee) method to generate the right path.
ie: 
```
Instead of href="/companies/5/employees/2/edit", id number should swap and show href="/companies/2/employees/5/edit" 
as the 2 the company Id and 5 the Employee ID and not the other way round.
```

While clicking on "Show" in any company in the "Listing Companies" page, it always
show the details for company with ID=1 (Mickeys Plaice).

#### Solution:
We should remove the "@company = Company.first" in the method "show" in 
"app/controllers/companies_controller.rb".

When creating a new Employee and inserting values for both fields "Forename" and "Surname",after clicking on "Save", the error message "Surname can't be blank" is being displayed. 

Solution:  The text needs to be changed in "app/views/employees/new.html.erb"

Error:   
```  
    <p>
        <%= form.label :surname %>
        <%= form.text_field :middlename, class: "form-control" %>
    </p>
```
    
#### Solution:
```
    <p>
        <%= form.label :surname %>
        <%= form.text_field :surname, class: "form-control" %>
    </p>
```
